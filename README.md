# NVIDIA Financial Modeling

This project presents an **end-to-end financial analysis and valuation** of **NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)**, demonstrating core competencies in financial modeling, data analysis, and visualization using Python.

---

## Overview

The project focuses on analyzing NVIDIA’s financial performance, forecasting future revenues, and estimating intrinsic value using **Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)** and **comparable multiples** methods.

---

## Objectives

* Structure and clean financial data using **Pandas**
* Compute key **profitability and efficiency ratios**
* Build a **revenue forecast model** assuming a 25% CAGR
* Perform **valuation analysis** using DCF and multiples
* Visualize key insights with **Matplotlib/Seaborn**

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric                   | Value |
| :----------------------- | :---- |
| **Profit Margin**        | 57%   |
| **ROE**                  | 56%   |
| **Revenue Growth (YoY)** | 56%   |

## Methodology

1. **Data Engineering:** Financial data imported, cleaned, and structured using `pandas`.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Trend and ratio analysis across income statement and balance sheet items.
3. **Forecasting:** Revenue projected at **25% CAGR** based on historical performance.
4. **Valuation:** Intrinsic value estimated through **DCF** and **comparable company** analysis.
5. **Visualization:** Created executive-style dashboards for communicating insights.
